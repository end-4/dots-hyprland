# (all pulseaudio sinks(outputs) have 'monitor' sources(inputs) associated with them).
#
# For alsa 'source' will be the capture device.
# For fifo 'source' will be the path to fifo-file.

[output]

# stream of the bar heights that can be used to send to other applications.
# 'raw' defaults to 200 bars, which can be adjusted in the 'bars' option above.

# Visual channels. Can be 'stereo' or 'mono'.

[color]

# if supported, ncurses mode will be forced on if user defined colors are used.
# default is to keep current terminal color

# background must also be defined in hex  or remain commented out. 1 = on, 0 = off.
# You can define as many as 8 different colors. They range from bottom to top of screen
# In the [color] section
