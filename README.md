# üîß General instructions
 - **_A guided install script exists, but very incomplete. I recommend against using it._**
 - **Backup**
 - Copy `Pictures`, `.config`, `.local` to home folder
 - Copy `execs` to a $PATH
 - gnome-text-editor themes: Structured like root, go inside and copy...
 - Install font Product Sans and Segoe UI Variable yourself
 - Get "Plasma Browser Integration" extension for your browser (for media player to display properly)
 - Install stuff to provide missing commands (list below) 
 
# üé® eww (yes I spend too much time on this)
 ## Performance
|  ‚åÑ  | Do use | Not recommended | Notes |
| --- | ------ | ----------- | ----- |
| Kernel |     |    | `auto-cpufreq` + unplugged = might be unresponsive |
| Login shell | bash/zsh | fish | It's okay to use fish in a terminal - that's what I do |

 ## Setup
 - This eww config only works in `~/.config/eww`
 - Start eww with `eww daemon`
 - To open the top bar, run `eww open bar` (for lineage branch, also run: `eww open barbg`)
 - To open the Windows bar, run `eww open winbar`
 - To open the bottom line, run `eww open bottomline` (so that the music window opens if you click the bottom edge of the screen)
 - Open the overview and wait 10 seconds (for it to generate app search cache, or icons won't show properly)
 ## Usage
 - Music control with the leftmost button of bars: Middle-click for Play/Pause, Right-click for Next track, scroll to change volume
 - To open the Overview, middle/right-click the workspace indicators or run `eww open overview`
 - You can type to search in overview!
 ## Search
 - Type normally to search apps
 - Type something beginning with a number and it'll be calculated (`qalc` is used for backend)
 - `>save THEME`: Saves current colorscheme, with THEME as the name.
 - `>load THEME`: Loads a saved theme. Available themes will be shown as you type.
 - `>music`: Get colorscheme from current media thumbnail
 - `>wall`: Get colorscheme from wallpaper located in `~/.config/eww/images/wallpaper/wallpaper` (might take quite a while)
 - `>light`: Remember to generate light theme for future schemes
 - `>dark`: Remember to generate dark theme for future schemes
 - `>r`: Reload (kills and relaunches eww with the default bar)
