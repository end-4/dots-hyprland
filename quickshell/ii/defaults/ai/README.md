## A note about sources of the prompts

- `ii-` prefixed ones are from illogical impulse
- The Acchan one is from [Nyarch Assistant](https://github.com/NyarchLinux/NyarchAssistant) (GPLv3). I know there's already the Imouto one but this one's very ðŸ˜­ðŸ’¢
- `w-` prefixed ones... I don't remember what w stands for but these prompts are [*cough cough*] inspired by certain apps
