# Install scripts for Gentoo

Note:
- The scripts here are **not** meant to be executed directly.
- This folder should reflect the equivalents of `/dist-arch/` but under Gentoo.
  - **When `/dist-arch/` is newer than this folder, an update on this folder is very likely needed.**

## install-deps.sh
1. Enables localrepo and guru overlays if not already enabled.
2. Copies _keywords_ to _keywords-user_ and appends the correct unmask keywords for the user's architecture (adm64, arm64, and x86 are supported).
3. _keywords-user_ and _useflags_ are copies over into the proper portage directories. Quickshell also uses a live ebuild.
4. Syncs, updates, and depcleans @world.
5. Copies over the custom live ebuilds (hyprgraphics, hyprland-qt-support, hyprland-qtutils, hyprlang, hyprwayland-scanner) into localrepo and digests them.
6. Loops through all illogical-impulse ebuilds to digest and emerge them.

## install-setup.sh
1. Creates the _i2c_ group since Gentoo doesn't have this by default, then adds the user to it.
2. Enables _bluetooth_ and _ydotool_ services (systemd or openrc)
3. _icons_, _konsole_, _hypr_, and _quickshell_ are are chowned to user since they're emerge in as root by default.
4. gsettings and kwriteconfig6 are set (same as dist-arch).

## Recommended use flags (useflags)
- Pipewire is used, alsa and pulseaudio are disabled (enabling them won't hurt).
- Init system is not assumed or considered so disabling systemd should be done in make.conf, same with session managers (elogind is recommended).

## Making the dot-files work
- pipewire, pipewire-pulse, and wireplumber must be started after a dbus-session is created and before Hyprland is launched.

If you want to start after logging into tty1 you can do something like this.
```fish
if status --is-interactive; and [ (tty) = "/dev/tty1" ]
    # Start DBus session if not running
    if not set -q DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
        dbus-launch --sh-syntax | sed 's/^/set -gx /; s/=/ /' | source
    end

    # Start PipeWire if not running
    pgrep -x pipewire >/dev/null; or pipewire &
    pgrep -x pipewire-pulse >/dev/null; or pipewire-pulse &
    pgrep -x wireplumber >/dev/null; or wireplumber &

    # Launch Hyprland with DBus session
    exec Hyprland
end
```
