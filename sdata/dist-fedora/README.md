# Install scripts for Fedora Linux

- Synchronize all dependencies in arch.
- I've tested it on Fedora 43 (KDE Plasma Desktop Edition) on the x86_64 platform.
- If you have any questions, please submit them to the discussions section.

# Usage
- `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland ~/.cache/dots-hyprland`
- `cd ~/.cache/dots-hyprland`
- `./setup install`

After installation, you may be prompted to delete some font files; ignore that.
