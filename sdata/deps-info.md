Notes
- Some Hyprland-adjacent packages appear in a legacy removal list as -git variants (e.g., hypridle, hyprlock, xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland). This suggests the meta-packages likely standardized on stable repo versions now.
- Exact package lists per meta-package should be verified against the PKGBUILD files in sdist/arch/*; the above is aligned with how the code uses these tools.
